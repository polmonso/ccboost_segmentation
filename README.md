EspINA Neuron Analyzer ccboost synapse/mitochondria segmentation plugin and import plugin.

The current version of the plugin is under development and uses the develop branch of EspINA, about to be released.

![EspINA Screenshot](/../task-based/Screenshots/espina2.png "Mitochondria segmentation")

### How do I get set up? ###

* Configuration

add ```-std=c++11``` flag

* Dependencies

- iiboost and its deps directory (you'll fetch it with git-submodule below)
- ITK (probably 4)
- VTK (probably 6)
- qt4
- openmp
and
- Espina (see below)

* IIBoost submodule

If you haven't cloned the repository with modules, namely

```
#!bash
git clone --recursive git@bitbucket.org:polmonso/ccboost-segmentation.git
```

you can clone the submodules after the fact with

```
#!bash
cd ccboost-segmentation
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

* build

On the ccboost-segmentation directory

```
#!bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++11"
make

```
You'll get a Espina missing warning, it's fine if you want to use the standalone version only.

If you need to add the dependencies path use `ccmake ..` to add them

* Running

the binary is ccbooststandalone and is ran like this:

```
#!bash

./ccbooststandalone -t trainingvolume.tif -g groundtruth.tif -i volumeinput.tif -o predictionoutputfilename.tif
```


i.e.


```
#!bash

./ccbooststandalone -g Madrid_Train_espinagt_many.tif -i Madrid_Train.tif -o predict.tif
```

## Working with git submodules
tl; dr

After Git 1.8.2, update the submodule spear to master branch with:
```
git submodule update --remote
```

--

Before Git 1.8.2

* pulling the latest submodule code

If submodule upstream is updated and you now want to update, change to the submodule directory

```
cd submodule_dir
```
checkout desired branch and update
```
git checkout master
git pull
```

Then get back to your project root. Now the submodules are in the state you want, so you can commit the changes

```
cd ..
git commit -am "Pulled down update to submodule_dir"
```

* [Git 1.8.2][1] added the possibility to track branches. 

> "`git submodule`" started learning a new mode to **integrate with the tip of the remote branch** (as opposed to integrating with the commit recorded in the superproject's gitlink).
    
    # add submodule to track master branch
    git submodule add -b master [URL to Git repo];

    # update your submodule
    git submodule update --remote

See "**[How to make an existing submodule track a branch][3]**" (if you had a submodule already present you wish now would track a branch)

## Espina installation troubleshooting

- Use the official [Espina](http://cajalbbp.cesvima.upm.es/espina/) or request access to the private repository to [Jorge Pe√±a](https://bitbucket.org/jorgepenapastor) 

The instruction to install it are [here](https://bitbucket.org/espina-developers/espina)

- You can also get some of the dependencies (xlslib and quazip) from [here](http://)

- If you get a message saying 'ill-formed pair', there's a problem with boost. Check that you have boost 1.55.
- If quazip is expecting quazip/ includes, change the include/quazip to include/ on the cmake variable 

This is the espina/CMakeLists.txt modified beginning:

```
include_directories("~/code/espina-project2/xlslib/src/")
link_directories("~/code/espina-project2/xlslib/src/.libs/")

set(XLSLIB_INCLUDE_DIR "~/code/espina-project2/xlslib/src/")
set(XLSLIB_LIBRARY "~/code/espina-project2/xlslib/src/.libs/libxls.so")

link_directories("/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/")

add_definitions(
  -std=c++11
  -fpermissive
  )
  
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake/Modules/")

find_package(QuaZip REQUIRED)
include_directories(${QUAZIP_INCLUDE_DIRS})
#if (NOT DEFINED MINGW AND NOT DEFINED MSVC)
#  include(${QUAZIP_USE_FILE})
#endif (NOT DEFINED MINGW AND NOT DEFINED MSVC)

find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS  graph regex)
link_directories ( ${Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS} )
include_directories ( ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS} )
```


# Detailed Description of the Code Structure

## CvlabPanel

The code provides a Cvlab Qt Panel for espina which connects with Ccboost Segmentation Plugin, who manages everything.

The plugin provides three tasks:

* Import segmentation [image]

This triggers the Import task which reads an image and imports its labels into Espina Segmentations.

* Synapse Segmentation [image]

This button triggers a Ccboost segmentation task with the element selected to Synapse, which means that will search the Espina's taxonomy tree for Synapse examples (either by Category Synapse or tag yessynapse) and negative examples by Background category or nosynapse tag.

To add tags within espina look at the segmentation list panel.

* Mitochondria Segmentation [image]

Same as the Synapse Segmentation but now it searches for the Mitochondria segmentation category or yesmitochondria|nomitochondria tags.

All three end up creating a preview that has to be thresholded using this same panel. Once happy, press the Extract Segmentation button [image].



These tasks are created at the Ccboost Plugin, which is the manager of our algorithms. To be consequently executed as a Espina Task, a child of QThread. Once the task finishes it is captured by the plugin again. 

This can be seen at ```CcboostSegmentationPlugin::create*Task( ... ):292```

     SchedulerSPtr scheduler = getScheduler();
     CCB::ImportTaskSPtr importTask{new CCB::ImportTask(channel, scheduler, filename)};
     struct CcboostSegmentationPlugin::ImportData data;
     m_executingImportTasks.insert(importTask.get(), data);
     connect(importTask.get(), SIGNAL(finished()), this, SLOT(finishedImportTask()));
     Task::submit(importTask);

The other particulars of the Ccboost Plugin follow. The description of the Ccboost and Import tasks are next.

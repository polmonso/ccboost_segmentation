- speed-up: sort samples by ROI idx

- fix ROIData::init() with pointers and mean-var normalization

- less memory-intensive mean-variance normalization:
		we should at least use float instead of double in statistics

- python: multiple ROIs for prediction
- python: check that C order is passed in train() and predict()
- python: add more options (num weak learners search per iter, etc)


- Allow for providing channels through the python interface
